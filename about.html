                <span id="bio"><br><strong>John Doe </strong>is a writer and a photographic artist who specialises in evocative images of the living world.<br> 
                    Born in South Africa in 1953, he first used the camera to document life in South Africa during the apartheid years. <br>
                    He moved to England in 1977 and co-founded one of Londonâ€™s leading photographic special effects companies. <br>
                    With the use of pioneering digital techniques, he quickly built up a world-wide client base and worked on many prestigious <br>
                    campaigns, including the official posters for the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games.
                    His venture into animal photography was a continuation of his exploration of different genres of photography, and it struck a chord <br>
                    with the general public. His goal was to use images to communicate with the masses, and take photography exhibitions outside galleries. <br>
                    This was done in spectacular fashion with the publication of Untamed in ten languages for its first edition, and the staging of major <br>
                    outdoor exhibitions called Spirit of the Wild. The exhibition has been seen by millions of people in eleven European cities. <br>
                    In Copenhagen, more than 1.4 million visitors were officially counted during the five month run.</span>
